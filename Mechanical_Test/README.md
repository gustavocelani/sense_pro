# Mechanical Test

The prototype was subject a mechanical test to gauge your resistance. The resistance test was performed in quintupleta using new sets of fingers printed under the same conditions, being: 70% of density and 0,84mm of layer. 62g and 20,28m of ABS filament were spent totalizing 9h44min to print each set.

The test consisted in the application of masses on the fingers simulating the act of carrying a plastic bag. With the prototype orthogonal to the ground holding a plastic bag of despicable mass were gradually added masses of 50g. For each mass addition, the prototype was submitted to 3 uninterrupted support minutes, with a 1 minute rest interval.

The average maximun weight supported by the prototype was 3,86Kg, with a standard deviation of 0,22Kg and a variance of 0,05Kg. Using the mass range obtained in the Chebyshev Theorem (3,50Kg to 4,10Kg), it was found a reliability of the results of 89,48%. It can be verified by gaussian generate by the tests and the Chebyshev Theorem.
