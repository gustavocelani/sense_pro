# Reliability Gaussian

The average maximun weight supported by the prototype was 3,86Kg, with a standard deviation of 0,22Kg and a variance of 0,05Kg. Using the mass range obtained in the Chebyshev Theorem (3,50Kg to 4,10Kg), it was found a reliability of the results of 89,48%. It can be verified by gaussian generate by the tests and the Chebyshev Theorem.
